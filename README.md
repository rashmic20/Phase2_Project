Hypothesis Testing Project

Hypothesis testing is a statistical tool to test an assumption regarding the population parameter. This project is dedicated to hypothesis testing. In this project, I have discussed hypothesis testing, p-value, significance level, types of errors in hypothesis testing, one-tailed tests, and two-tailed tests.
